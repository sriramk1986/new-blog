Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Sriram! After working in Finance and starting an [EdTech venture](http://learningroots.in/us), I now write code for a living and love doing it. I started off learning Ruby (with Rails) and JavaScript at [Le Wagon, Tokyo](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo), but now mainly deal with Python and Django along with the DevOps bells and whistles of Docker, Kubernetes, and CircleCI.

Apart from my regular work, I love reading books. Do check out the books section of the blog. I plan to take notes from my readings and add them there. 

I also love quizzing and have won (and lost miserably) a fair share of quizzes. You can see some of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9-BwHN6Hk), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in-kOYcr0_I) and [here](https://www.tatacrucible.com/campus/report2013/mumbai.html)
